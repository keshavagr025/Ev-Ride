ML Steps (20â€“25%)

Preprocessing (label encoding, scaling)
Training KNN model
Evaluating metrics (Accuracy, F1)
Saving the model


Integration & Deployment (75â€“80%)

Setting up backend (Flask/FastAPI/Django)
Designing frontend (React/HTML)
Connecting frontend â†” backend via REST API
Deployment on cloud

<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1. Data Understanding + Cleaning (10%)
Missing value handling (imputation)
Outlier detection (Z-score / IQR method)
Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, correlations)
Feature distribution analysis

2. Feature Engineering (10%)
Create new features like:
Average speed = distance / duration
Time of day (morning/evening/night) from timestamp
Weekend vs weekday
Encode categorical variables in different ways (OneHot, LabelEncoding)
Try feature selection (Variance Threshold, Mutual Information)

3. Multiple Models & Comparison (15%)

Donâ€™t stop at KNN. Train at least 3â€“4 models and compare:
Logistic Regression
KNN
Decision Tree / Random Forest
SVM
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM if allowed)

Show comparison with Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall.
This adds depth to ML part.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning (5â€“10%)
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize n_neighbors in KNN, max_depth in Decision Trees, etc.
This shows you really worked on ML instead of just running defaults.

5. Model Evaluation & Explainability (5â€“10%)
Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curve
Cross-validation results
Feature importance (for tree-based models)
SHAP/LIME for interpretability (optional but very strong for marks)

ðŸ”¹ How much Integration (50%)

Once ML part is strong, your integration should cover:
Saving the best trained model
Creating Flask/FastAPI backend
React frontend (simple UI form)
Connecting via REST API
Deployment (Heroku/Render + Netlify/Vercel)

This balance looks like:
ML: 50% â†’ Data prep, multiple models, tuning, evaluation, feature engineering, explainability


Integration: 50% â†’ API, frontend, backend, deployment
